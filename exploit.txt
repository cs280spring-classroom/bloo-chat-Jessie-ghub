In index.js app.get('/chatroom') function, if verification succeed, the server echos client
inputs username (e.g., query strings) back to the client (io.emit('new', username);), which
incurs a reflected XSS.

The original purpose is to output a welcome sentence if you use the following URL.

http://localhost:7000/chatroom?uname=jessie

However, if an adversary crafts a URL and sends the URL to a victim, the victim is subject to XSS.

http://localhost:8080/?username=<script>alert(1)</script>
